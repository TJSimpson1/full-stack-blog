Blog Application 

A simple blog application using Node.js (Express server & MongoDB database) and React with Firebase authentication.

## Project Status

## Reflection

  - The basis for this project follows a LinkedIn Learning course, which I chose to complete in order to gain an understanding of Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Firebase, which I hadn't used before.
  - After completing the course, I continued to add features to consolidate my understanding of what I had learned.
  - Usually for a full stack application such as this one, I would create a Spring Boot REST API with an H2 database (not live projects so in-memory is sufficient for practice), but I wanted to learn a new way to create a full stack application and to broaden my understanding of different topics.
